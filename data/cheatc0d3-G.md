## G-01 Minimizing storage operations by consolidating changes and applying them in a single update can save gas

#### [Loc](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-coinbase/blob/main/src/MagicSpend/MagicSpend.sol#L138)
```solidity
_withdrawableETH[userOp.sender] += withdrawAmount - maxCost;
context = abi.encode(maxGasCost, userOp.sender);
_withdrawableETH[userOp.sender] += (maxGasCost - actualGasCost);
```

#### Change to

```solidity
uint256 updatedAmount = _withdrawableETH[userOp.sender] + withdrawAmount - maxCost;
updatedAmount += (maxGasCost - actualGasCost); // Adjust based on actual costs
_withdrawableETH[userOp.sender] = updatedAmount; // Single storage update
context = abi.encode(maxGasCost, userOp.sender);
```

## G-02 Optimize event for gas

Remove nonce from event to save gas as it's mainly used for operation security and not necessarily information tracking.

Indexed event parameters take more gas consider removing the indexed asset parameter to save on gas since only ETH is supported currently.


## G-03 Reorder struct fields to potentially save on gas when additional fields get added

To optimize the struct, you should order the fields from largest to smallest, considering that dynamically sized fields (like bytes and dynamically sized arrays) are stored separately from fixed-size fields
