The Codebase is well structured and well written, there were a couple of issues which I believe if fixed makes this codebase and project solid and almost good to go.

Recommendations:
- Fuzz Tests are needed in the tests
- Consensus feature should be implemented for execute or executeBatch in the SmartWallet to reduce the risk of maliciousness of one owner using the wallet to execute selfish transactions for a wallet owned by multiple owners
