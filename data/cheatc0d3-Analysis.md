# Coinbase Smart Wallet Security Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
During my audit of the Coinbase Smart Wallet, I identified various security concerns and operational inefficiencies. This report outlines my findings and provides actionable steps for mitigation. The issues range from critical vulnerabilities that could lead to financial losses or contract malfunctions, to optimizations that can significantly reduce gas costs and improve contract efficiency. It's crucial for the development team to prioritize these findings to enhance the security, reliability, and performance of the smart wallet.

---

## Scope

The scope of this audit focused on key components of the Coinbase Smart Wallet system, including the SmartWallet contract, WebAuthnSol, FreshCryptoLib, and the MagicSpend module. The aim was to identify security vulnerabilities, architectural weaknesses, and any deviations from best practices that could impact the system's integrity, security, and functionality. Specifically, the audit concentrated on areas susceptible to cross-chain replay attacks, adherence to validation protocols, the integrity of cryptographic operations, and the efficiency and security of the paymaster functions within the MagicSpend module. This comprehensive approach ensured that critical aspects of the Coinbase Smart Wallet were examined to safeguard against potential exploits and operational inefficiencies.

## Architecture Overview

### SmartWallet
The SmartWallet is designed to support cross-chain operations but relies on `executeWithoutChainIdValidation` for cross-chain replay, which assumes gas values from one chain will be valid on another. This assumption poses risks due to variable gas requirements across different blockchains.

### WebAuthnSol
The `WebAuthn.sol` contract focuses on authentication, explicitly outlining certain validation steps that are intentionally skipped. This approach raises concerns regarding the robustness of authentication mechanisms implemented within the system.

### FreshCryptoLib
`FreshCryptoLib` is a library aimed at providing cryptographic functions, with the understanding that exploits are primarily relevant when initiated through `ecdsa_verify`. The audit identified specific issues in `ecAff_isOnCurve` and `ecZZ_mulmuladd_S_asm` functions, which have been addressed post-discovery in a previous audit. These fixes were crucial for ensuring the cryptographic integrity of operations within the library.

### MagicSpend
Operating as a paymaster, `MagicSpend` interfaces with the `EntryPoint` contract, managing gas payments for transactions. Issues were found regarding how `MagicSpend` calculates and covers gas costs, potentially leading to discrepancies in balance management. Additionally, the use of `address.balance` in `validatePaymasterUserOp` was identified as a violation of ERC-7562 rules, although a pending PR aims to rectify this.

The architecture of the Coinbase Smart Wallet is multifaceted, with each component playing a critical role in the system's overall functionality and security. The identified issues and the subsequent fixes are steps towards enhancing the robustness and reliability of the system, addressing both security vulnerabilities and architectural inefficiencies.


## Findings

### Vulnerability to Front-running Attacks on Bundled Transactions

I discovered that the smart wallet is susceptible to front-running attacks, specifically targeting bundled transactions. Malicious actors could observe and exploit transactions waiting in the mempool, leading to financial losses or even causing the paymaster to be banned due to perceived unreliability. This vulnerability arises from a lack of safeguards against sudden balance decreases that might cause transactions to fail.


- Implement private transaction relayers or services like Flashbots to obscure transactions from the public mempool.

- Maintain a buffer of funds that aren't immediately available for withdrawal, providing a safeguard against unexpected balance drops.

### Advantages of Using ERC-1167 Clones for Smart Wallets

I found that employing ERC-1167 clones for smart wallets can significantly reduce deployment costs and enhance operational efficiency. This method allows for each wallet instance to operate independently while sharing the same underlying logic, ideal for creating multiple user-specific wallets efficiently.

Integrate ERC-1167 clone contracts into the smart wallet deployment process to leverage their cost and operational efficiencies.

---

### Integration Constraints Due to `isContract` Checks

The smart wallet's integration with certain DeFi protocols and smart contract systems might be limited due to `isContract` checks. These checks can restrict the wallet's ability to interact with contracts requiring caller differentiation, potentially limiting its functionality and interoperability.

Explore alternative methods or workarounds for interaction with protocols employing `isContract` checks to ensure broad compatibility and functionality.

---

### Denial of Service Risks Due to Excessive Payload Size

I identified a potential Denial of Service (DoS) risk stemming from the allowance of large `initCode`, `callData`, and `paymasterAndData` payloads. These can increase transaction costs and risk exceeding block gas limits, impacting the network and the contract's performance.

Implement strict size limits on `initCode`, `callData`, and `paymasterAndData` to mitigate the risk of excessive transaction sizes.

---

### Risks of High Gas Limits

The smart wallet's settings allow for potentially dangerous gas limit specifications, which could be exploited to perform DoS attacks or manipulate transaction outcomes. High or low gas limits could lead to transaction failure or the exploitation of the paymaster's funds.

Define and enforce maximum gas limits for `callGasLimit` and `verificationGasLimit` based on typical operation costs to prevent abuse.

---

### Optimizing Storage Operations

I noted that the smart wallet could achieve gas savings by consolidating storage operations. Currently, multiple updates to a user's withdrawable ETH balance occur in separate transactions, leading to unnecessary gas consumption.

Consolidate changes to a user's balance into a single storage operation to minimize gas usage.

---

## Conclusion

This report highlights critical and optimization-level issues discovered during my audit of the Coinbase Smart Wallet. Addressing these findings will not only enhance the security and operational efficiency of the smart wallet but also ensure its long-term sustainability and user trust. It's recommended that the team prioritizes these issues based on their impact and implements the suggested actionable steps to mitigate the identified risks.
