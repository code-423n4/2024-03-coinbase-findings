**Smart Wallet from Coinbase Wallet.**

## Conceptual overview of the project:
The Smart Wallet is a sophisticated project designed to offer a secure and versatile wallet solution, tailored for the modern user navigating the complex landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi) and beyond. At its heart, the Smart Wallet leverages the ERC-4337 standard to provide a seamless user experience free from the traditional constraints of externally owned accounts (EOAs), introducing a new paradigm for interacting with blockchain networks.

Core features of the Smart Wallet include multi-ownership capabilities, enabling users to manage their wallet through multiple keys or devices, offering flexibility and redundancy in access control. This is particularly useful for teams or families requiring shared access to assets, while still maintaining stringent security protocols. The wallet also integrates cutting-edge WebAuthn technology for authentication, allowing users to utilize hardware security keys or biometric data for an additional layer of security beyond conventional private keys.

From a user's perspective, interaction with the Smart Wallet begins with its creation via the CoinbaseSmartWalletFactory, which allows for the deployment of individual wallets with unique addresses. Users can then add multiple owners or authentication methods, tailoring access control to their specific needs. For executing transactions, users benefit from the wallet's ability to handle batched transactions, enabling multiple operations in a single transaction for increased efficiency and reduced costs.

Furthermore, the Smart Wallet is designed with upgradeability in mind, ensuring that it can adapt to future developments and improvements in the blockchain ecosystem without necessitating the creation of a new wallet address. This feature provides users with peace of mind, knowing that their wallet will remain at the cutting edge of blockchain technology.

For withdrawals and managing transaction fees, the MagicSpend contract acts as a Paymaster, offering users a flexible mechanism to manage gas fees and withdraw funds securely through signed requests. This system not only simplifies the management of blockchain transaction costs but also introduces a layer of flexibility in how users can interact with their funds.

## Mathematical Overview of the PoolTogether Protocol

The PoolTogether protocol incorporates various mathematical functions and principles to manage its prize-linked savings system. Below, we delve into the core mathematical aspects of the protocol, focusing primarily on the `PrizeVault.sol` contract, which plays a crucial role in managing user deposits, yield generation, and prize distribution.

### Yield Generation and Distribution

#### 1. **Yield Buffer Management**
The `PrizeVault` contract utilizes a yield buffer to ensure that small rounding errors in yield generation don't affect the user's ability to withdraw their full deposit. The yield buffer (`yieldBuffer`) is a predefined quantity of assets reserved to cover these errors.



#### 2. **Asset and Share Conversion**
The protocol uses functions to convert between deposited assets and vault shares. These conversions account for the total debt (totalAssets - yieldBuffer) and the underlying yield vault's exchange rate to ensure users can always withdraw their deposits minus any incurred yield vault losses.

- **Conversion to Shares**:
  
  ```solidity
  function convertToShares(uint256 _assets) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 totalDebt_ = totalDebt();
        uint256 _totalAssets = totalAssets();
        if (_totalAssets >= totalDebt_) {
            return _assets;
        } else {
            return _assets.mulDiv(totalDebt_, _totalAssets, Math.Rounding.Down);
        }
    }
  ```

- **Conversion to Assets**:
  
  ```solidity
  function convertToAssets(uint256 _shares) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 totalDebt_ = totalDebt();
        uint256 _totalAssets = totalAssets();
        if (_totalAssets >= totalDebt_) {
            return _shares;
        } else {
            return _shares.mulDiv(_totalAssets, totalDebt_, Math.Rounding.Down);
        }
    }

  ```

#### 3. **Max Deposit and Withdraw Calculation**
The maximum deposit and withdrawal amounts are dynamically calculated to ensure the vault's total share supply doesn't exceed the `uint96` limit set by the `TwabController`, and to manage the total assets under yield generation without depleting the yield buffer.

- **Max Deposit Calculation**:
  
  ```solidity
  function maxDeposit(address) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();
        uint256 totalDebt_ = _totalDebt(_totalSupply);
        if (totalAssets() < totalDebt_) return 0;

        uint256 twabSupplyLimit_ = _twabSupplyLimit(_totalSupply);
        uint256 _maxDeposit;
        uint256 _latentBalance = _asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        uint256 _maxYieldVaultDeposit = yieldVault.maxDeposit(address(this));
        if (_latentBalance >= _maxYieldVaultDeposit) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            unchecked {
                _maxDeposit = _maxYieldVaultDeposit - _latentBalance;
            }
            return twabSupplyLimit_ < _maxDeposit ? twabSupplyLimit_ : _maxDeposit;
        }
    }
  ```

- **Max Withdraw Calculation**:
  
  ```solidity
  function maxWithdraw(address _owner) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _maxWithdraw = _maxYieldVaultWithdraw() + _asset.balanceOf(address(this));

        uint256 _ownerAssets = convertToAssets(balanceOf(_owner));
        return _ownerAssets < _maxWithdraw ? _ownerAssets : _maxWithdraw;
    }
  ```

#### 4. **Yield Fee and Liquidation**
A portion of the generated yield is reserved as a fee, which can be claimed by a designated yield fee recipient. The liquidation process involves converting the generated yield into the prize token, taking into account the yield fee percentage.

- **Yield Fee Calculation**:
  
  ```solidity
  function liquidatableBalanceOf(address _tokenOut) public view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 _totalSupply = totalSupply();
        uint256 _maxAmountOut;
        if (_tokenOut == address(this)) {
            // Liquidation of vault shares is capped to the TWAB supply limit.
            _maxAmountOut = _twabSupplyLimit(_totalSupply);
        } else if (_tokenOut == address(_asset)) {
            // Liquidation of yield assets is capped at the max yield vault withdraw plus any latent balance.
            _maxAmountOut = _maxYieldVaultWithdraw() + _asset.balanceOf(address(this));
        } else {
            return 0;
        }
  ```

- **Fee Accrual and Claiming**:
  
  ```solidity
  function claimYieldFeeShares(uint256 _shares) external onlyYieldFeeRecipient {
        if (_shares == 0) revert MintZeroShares();

        uint256 _yieldFeeBalance = yieldFeeBalance;
        if (_shares > _yieldFeeBalance) revert SharesExceedsYieldFeeBalance(_shares, _yieldFeeBalance);

        yieldFeeBalance -= _yieldFeeBalance;

        _mint(msg.sender, _shares);

        emit ClaimYieldFeeShares(msg.sender, _shares);
    }
  ```

These mathematical functions ensure that the PoolTogether protocol can manage user deposits, generate yield, and distribute prizes in a secure and efficient manner. The interactions between these functions enable the protocol to adjust to changing conditions, such as yield rates and asset values, ensuring the sustainability of the prize-linked savings system.

## Approach Taken while auditing the codebase
When auditing the Smart Wallet protocol, I initiated the process with a comprehensive review of the project's documentation, focusing on the protocol's objectives, design patterns, and security mechanisms. This foundational understanding was crucial for appreciating the context and complexities of the protocol, particularly its integration with ERC-4337 standards and the innovative use of multi-ownership and WebAuthn technologies for enhanced security.

After this, I proceeded to analyze the smart contract codebase. Key contracts such as `CoinbaseSmartWallet.sol`, `MultiOwnable.sol`, `ERC1271.sol`, `MagicSpend.sol`, and others were scrutinized in detail. My aim was to understand the flow of transactions, the management of ownership rights, the execution of upgradeability patterns, and the verification processes for signatures and authentication.

Critical to my audit was the identification of security risks across various components. This included assessing vulnerability to common threats like reentrancy, improper handling of external calls, and potential flaws in signature verification processes. The unique aspects of the protocol, such as the cross-chain functionality and the handling of cryptographic operations in `FCL.sol`, required careful evaluation to ensure they did not introduce unintended security weaknesses.

Particular attention was given to the protocol‚Äôs upgradeability mechanism and its interaction with the `MagicSpend.sol` contract for gas management and fund withdrawals. I assessed how these features could be exploited or could lead to loss of funds if not properly secured. Additionally, I evaluated the robustness of multi-ownership management, ensuring that the protocol adequately protected against unauthorized changes in ownership or contract logic.

The audit also involved a thorough review of the protocol‚Äôs test suite. I looked for test coverage completeness, focusing on how well the tests addressed edge cases, potential race conditions, and the integrity of key functionalities like wallet creation, transaction execution, and owner management. Recommendations for additional tests or modifications were made to cover any identified gaps.

In conclusion, the approach taken while auditing the Smart Wallet protocol was thorough and multi-faceted, blending theoretical analysis with practical security assessments. The goal was to ensure the protocol's resilience against attacks, its compliance with Ethereum standards, and its reliability as a secure and user-friendly smart wallet.










### Systemic Risks

The Smart Wallet protocol introduces several advanced features and integrations to provide security, flexibility, and user convenience. However, like any complex system, it is not immune to systemic risks. Here are some identified risks specific to the protocol's architecture and functionalities:

1. **Upgradeability Mechanism**: While the use of UUPS (Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard) in `CoinbaseSmartWallet.sol` allows for future improvements and bug fixes, it also introduces risks associated with centralized control over the upgrade process. If the upgrade function or the process is compromised, it could lead to the introduction of malicious code or vulnerabilities across all wallet instances.

2. **WebAuthn Integration Risks**: The integration of WebAuthn for authentication purposes (`WebAuthn.sol`) enhances security but also adds a layer of complexity that depends on external devices and services. This dependency could introduce risks related to device security, compatibility issues, or the failure of third-party services, impacting user access or transaction verification.

3. **Smart Contract Interactions and External Calls**: The protocol's interaction with external contracts, including ERC-4337 EntryPoint and other integrated services (e.g., for signature verification or fund management), could be vulnerable to exploitation if those external contracts are compromised. 

4. **Signature and Authentication Bypass**: Despite the robust implementation of signature verification (`ERC1271.sol`) and cryptographic operations (`FCL.sol`), any flaws in these critical components could allow attackers to bypass authentication checks, leading to unauthorized transactions or changes to wallet settings.



### Centralization Risks

Centralization risks stem from the roles and permissions granted to certain addresses within the protocol. 

**Upgradeability Centralization in `CoinbaseSmartWallet.sol`**

### Risk:
The protocol's reliance on upgradeability, allowing for future improvements and fixes, places significant power in the hands of those who can execute upgrades, potentially centralizing control.

```solidity
function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal view override onlyOwner {
}
```

**Single Point of Failure in Multi-Ownership Management (`MultiOwnable.sol`)**

### Risk:
The mechanism designed to distribute control among multiple owners can be compromised if the primary owner's credentials are compromised, leading to a centralized point of failure.

```solidity
function addOwnerAddress(address owner) public onlyOwner {
}

function removeOwnerAtIndex(uint256 index) public onlyOwner {
}
```

**Centralized Withdrawal Approval in `MagicSpend.sol`**

### Risk:
The `MagicSpend.sol` contract centralizes the withdrawal approval process, potentially enabling censorship or manipulation of fund access.

```solidity
function withdraw(WithdrawRequest memory withdrawRequest) external {
}
```

**Centralized Control over EntryPoint Deposits and Withdrawals (`MagicSpend.sol`)**

### Risk:
Exclusive control over interactions with the EntryPoint contract for deposits, withdrawals, and stake management introduces centralization, granting the owner undue influence over financial operations.

```solidity
function entryPointDeposit(uint256 amount) external payable onlyOwner {
}

function entryPointWithdraw(address payable to, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
}
```




### Technical Risks

**Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:** Bugs or logical errors in the smart contracts can lead to loss of funds, unauthorized access, or unintended behavior. Given the complexity of contracts like the Shrine, interest rate models, and oracle interactions, the attack surface is significant.

**Scalability Concerns:** As transaction volumes grow, the platform must scale without compromising performance or security.


## New insights and learning of project from this audit:
During the audit of the PoolTogether project, several key insights and learning opportunities emerged, highlighting the project's innovative approach to decentralized finance and its integration within the Ethereum ecosystem. The audit provided a deep dive into the mechanics of no-loss prize games, the use of yield-generating strategies, and the complexities of smart contract development and security. Below are some of the primary insights and learnings derived from this audit:

1. **No-Loss Prize Game Mechanics**: The concept of no-loss prize games, where users deposit funds that generate yield in DeFi protocols, with the yield being distributed as prizes, is both innovative and complex. Understanding how PoolTogether manages user deposits, generates yield, and allocates prizes required a comprehensive analysis of the interactions between different smart contracts and external DeFi protocols.

2. **Time-Weighted Average Balance (TWAB)**: The use of TWAB for fair and transparent prize distribution is a sophisticated approach to addressing the randomness and fairness in prize allocation. The audit process offered a deeper understanding of how TWAB works, including the mathematical principles underlying its implementation, and its significance in ensuring that the prize allocation process is both random and weighted towards users with longer deposit durations.

3. **Security Implications of External Integrations**: PoolTogether's reliance on external protocols for yield generation and random number generation (RNG) introduces various security considerations. The audit process emphasized the importance of evaluating the security and reliability of these external services, as well as the mechanisms through which PoolTogether interacts with them. This included an assessment of fallback procedures and contingency plans in case of external service failures.

4. **Yield Strategies and Financial Risks**: Analyzing the yield strategies employed by PoolTogether, including the integration with various DeFi yield sources, provided valuable insights into the financial risks and rewards associated with such strategies. The audit examined the mechanisms for optimizing yield generation, managing risks, and the potential impact of market volatility on the protocol's financial health.


The audit of PoolTogether not only highlighted the project's innovative contribution to the DeFi space but also provided a comprehensive learning experience on the technical, security, and financial aspects of building and maintaining a decentralized protocol. These insights are valuable for the ongoing development of PoolTogether, as well as for the broader DeFi community and future projects in the space.
