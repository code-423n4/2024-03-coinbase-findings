### Title: Owner Removal Gap in MultiOwnable Smart Contract

### Introduction

In the context of smart contract development, especially those involving multi-ownership functionalities, it's crucial to ensure that the contract's logic is robust, secure, and efficient. A recent audit of the `MultiOwnable.sol` contract within the Coinbase Smart Wallet project has uncovered a potential issue related to the removal of owners. This report aims to highlight the "Owner Removal Gap" vulnerability and its implications.

### Background

The `MultiOwnable.sol` contract is designed to manage multiple owners for a smart contract, allowing for a flexible and secure ownership model. It supports both Ethereum address owners and passkey (Secp256r1) public key owners, with each owner identified by a unique index. The contract provides functionalities for adding and removing owners, as well as checking ownership status.

### Finding

Upon reviewing the `removeOwnerAtIndex` function, it was observed that the removal of an owner does not update the `nextOwnerIndex`. This means that if an owner is removed, the `nextOwnerIndex` remains unchanged, potentially leading to gaps in the owner indices.

```solidity
97:     /// @notice Removes an owner from the given `index`.
98:     ///
99:     /// @dev Reverts if the owner is not registered at `index`.
100:     ///
101:     /// @param index The index to remove from.
102:     function removeOwnerAtIndex(uint256 index) public virtual onlyOwner {
103:         bytes memory owner = ownerAtIndex(index);
104:         if (owner.length == 0) revert NoOwnerAtIndex(index);
105: 
106:         delete _getMultiOwnableStorage().isOwner[owner];
107:         delete _getMultiOwnableStorage().ownerAtIndex[index];
108: 
109:         emit RemoveOwner(index, owner);
110:     }
```

### Implications

The presence of gaps in owner indices could lead to several potential issues:

1. **Confusion and Mismanagement**: The gaps could lead to confusion among contract administrators or developers, making it difficult to manage the list of owners effectively.

2. **Potential for Exploitation**: In scenarios where the contract logic relies on the continuity of owner indices, the presence of gaps could introduce vulnerabilities. For example, if the contract logic assumes that owner indices are always sequential without gaps, this could lead to bugs or vulnerabilities.

3. **Inefficiency**: The gaps could lead to inefficiencies in contract operations, especially if the contract needs to iterate over the owners frequently.

### Recommendation

To mitigate the "Owner Removal Gap" vulnerability, it is recommended to implement a mechanism that re-indexes the owners after an owner is removed. This could involve iterating over the owners and updating their indices accordingly. However, this approach should be carefully considered to avoid introducing new complexities or performance issues.

### Conclusion

The "Owner Removal Gap" vulnerability in the `MultiOwnable.sol` contract highlights the importance of meticulous contract design and thorough auditing. While the current implementation may not pose an immediate threat, it underscores the need for continuous vigilance in smart contract development to ensure security and efficiency.
