## [L-01] NatSpec comment on 255 owner limitation in `_addOwner()` being ambiguous
The discrepancy between the NatSpec comment in the `_addOwner` function of the MultiOwnable contract and its actual implementation could lead to misunderstandings about the contract's owner limit. The comment suggests a limit of 255 owners,

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-coinbase/blob/main/src/SmartWallet/MultiOwnable.sol#L176

```solidity
    /// @notice Convenience function used to add the first 255 owners.
```
but the code, utilizing `uint256` for indexing, 

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-coinbase/blob/main/src/SmartWallet/MultiOwnable.sol#L8-L9

```solidity
    /// @dev Tracks the index of the next owner to add.
    uint256 nextOwnerIndex;
```
does not enforce any such limit, allowing for a significantly larger number of owners.

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-coinbase/blob/main/src/SmartWallet/MultiOwnable.sol#L179-L181

```solidity
    function _addOwner(bytes memory owner) internal virtual {
        _addOwnerAtIndex(owner, _getMultiOwnableStorage().nextOwnerIndex++);
    }
```
This issue, while not affecting the contract's functionality or security directly, could cause confusion among developers and users, leading to potential misalignments in expectations and implementations. Addressing this through clarification in the documentation or by introducing an explicit limit, if desired, is recommended to ensure clear and accurate communication of the contract's capabilities. 

```diff
    function _addOwner(bytes memory owner) internal virtual {
+        require(_getMultiOwnableStorage().nextOwnerIndex < 255, "Owner limit reached");
        _addOwnerAtIndex(owner, _getMultiOwnableStorage().nextOwnerIndex++);
    }
```
## [NC-01] Typographical error in constant variable name
The constant variable `MUTLI_OWNABLE_STORAGE_LOCATION` in the MultiOwnable contract contains a typographical error, where "MULTI" is misspelled as "MUTLI". While being non-critical and not impacting the functionality, security, or performance of the contract, the typo could potentially cause mild confusion or readability issues for developers/users reviewing or interacting with the code. Correcting the spelling would enhance code clarity and maintain naming consistency without affecting the contract's execution or behavior.
