## [L-01] The code should revert when `success` is `false`

Reverting when success is false could enhance the semantic clarity of the code. If the preceding operation fails (success is false), it might be more explicit and easier to understand if the code immediately reverts rather than proceeding with further operations.

```solidity
File : src/WebAuthnSol/WebAuthn.sol

104:    function verify(

158:       if (success && valid) return abi.decode(ret, (uint256)) == 1;

```

## [L-02] The account may not be able to verify the outcome accurately as it returns success based solely on a true/false condition 

The account might not be able to verify the success of this operation adequately. If the success of the operation depends solely on a boolean value (true/false), it may not provide enough information for the account to determine whether the operation was successful or not. This lack of clarity could potentially lead to issues or vulnerabilities.

```solidity
File : src/SmartWallet/CoinbaseSmartWallet.sol

91:    modifier payPrefund(uint256 missingAccountFunds) virtual {
           _;

          assembly ("memory-safe") {
               if missingAccountFunds {
                    // Ignore failure (it's EntryPoint's job to verify, not the account's).
                    pop(call(gas(), caller(), missingAccountFunds, codesize(), 0x00, codesize(), 0x00))
                }
            }
        }

## [L-03] `initialize` function missing `initializer` `modifier`
`initilaizer` modifier ensures that `initialize` function should be called only once. If it is not present than this function can be called multiple times which is bad since this function is made like constructor for proxy. So better use `initializer` modifier on this function.
```solidity
File : src/SmartWallet/CoinbaseSmartWallet.sol

114:    function initialize(bytes[] calldata owners) public payable virtual {
            if (nextOwnerIndex() != 0) {
                revert Initialized();
            }

            _initializeOwners(owners);
        }

```
