# Overview
This project covers aims to secure smart wallet solution with robust signature validation, interoperability, and gas-efficient transaction capabilities, leveraging various cryptographic libraries and smart contract functionalities.
At its core is the `SmartWallet.sol`, a versatile smart contract wallet that accommodates multiple owners and validates their signatures via the `WebAuthn.sol` library. 

# Technical Architecture
As said by the project file , the protocol is divided into 4 modules :

>- `Smart-Wallet`: a smart contract wallet that is compliant with ERC-4337, validates their signatures using WebAuthnSol. and can work with paymasters such as MagicSpend.

>- `WebAuthn`:  library designed for verifying  passwordless authentication on the web.

>- `Fresh Crypto Lib` : used to check for signature malleability, which is important for ensuring the security of the system.

>- `Magic Spend`:  serves as a paymaster, allowing users to pay transaction gas with their withdrawals.


# Risk related to project
>- Owner privilages issue
>- Lack of event emission 

# Code Quality
The overall code quality is quite high:

>- Comments explain intention. 
>- Modular with separation of concerns.
>- Helper functions to reduce duplication.
>- Additional validation in state changing functions.


# Recommendation
>- Migration to DAO or multisig type instead of a owner privilages
>- Error handling via Result types.
>- More event emission
